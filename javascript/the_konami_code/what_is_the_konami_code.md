# What is the Konami code?

If you've been around for a while and have heard mentions of The Konami Code, then you're probably wondering... what is it?

In short, The Konami Code is a set of inputs that, when done in the correct order, preforms some hidden "easter egg" of sorts. 

**A breif history:**

The code was first used in the 1986 release of Gradius for the Nintendo Entertainment System but was popularized among North American players in the NES version of Contra, for which it was also dubbed both the "Contra Code" and "30 Lives Code", because of its nearly necessary use in the game.
